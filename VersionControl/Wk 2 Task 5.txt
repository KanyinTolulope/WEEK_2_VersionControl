Well, hi! This is me, Kanyinsola Sowemimo.

I am a dark slim pretty lady, and I know am tall!.

I am a Biochemist by profession, a programmer by passion.

I am an individual with many sides, and am yet to discover all; but am sure glad with the ones discovered.

My favourite colour is brown, a special shade.

My favourite meal, though I haven't eaten it in a while, is Amala with ogbolor soup,fish, turkey, and different animals on it!

I am in love, with God, myself and a man!!.
